This is a simple script for pretty-re-formatting Maven pom.xml <dependency>
stanzas. It's really a very trivial application.

   * README.md: This file
   * spacer.rb: the code that re-formats the markup
   * test.xml:  test data used by spacer.rb
   * plugin:    the source to a Textmate command version of this script
